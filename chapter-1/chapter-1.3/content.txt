1.3 FUNCTION TRANSFORMATIONS

To begin our discussion of function transformations, we must first think about
how arithmetically modifying the function both before and after its calculation
affects the final output of the function. As far as arithmetic operations giving us
transformations go, to simplify things we are going to talk only about the addition
and multiplication of constants, This is because subtraction is addition of a
negative, while division is multiplication of a reciprocal. Let's start with addition.
