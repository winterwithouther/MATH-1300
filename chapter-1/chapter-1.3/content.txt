1.3 FUNCTION TRANSFORMATIONS

To begin our discussion of function transformations, we must first think about
how arithmetically modifying the function both before and after its calculation
affects the final output of the function. As far as arithmetic operations giving us
transformations go, to simplify things we are going to talk only about the addition
and multiplication of constants, This is because subtraction is addition of a
negative, while division is multiplication of a reciprocal. Let's start with addition.

1.3.1 SHIFTS FROM ADDITION

The question is, how does f(x) compare to f(x + c) and f(x) + c? For
now, let's suppose f(0) = 0 since 0 is the identity of addition. This means
when the input value of f is 0, the output value, f(0) is also 0. So for
f(x + c), we know that if we were to plug in -c, we would get... f(-c + c) = f(0) = 0

So, we would need to adjust our inputs by the additive inverse (the "negative")
of c to get the known result of f(0) = 0 (if c is positive we need to move c
units to the left, if c is negative we need to move c units to the right, and if
c = 0 we have no horizontal movement)

for f(x) + c, we know... f(0) + c = 0 + c = c

So, we would need to adjust our outputs by the value of c (if c is positive we
need to move c units up, if c is negative we need to move |c| units to the down,
if c = 0 we have no movement)

One way to remember that the first case gave a horizontal shift and the second
a vertical shift, is to think of "when did we add c?" For f(x + c), first c gets added
to the original input of x, and then that modified input gets plugged into f. That is,
we added c to the input before it went through the calculation of f, giving us
a horizontal transformation. With f(x) + c, the original input x gets plugged into f,
and then c gets added to the output value of f. Here we added c after f was calculated,
so we have vertical transformation. We call these transformations shifts since they will
simply slide points left, right, up, or down.

1.3.2 SCALES FROM MULTIPLICATION

What about multiplication, f(c*x) and c*f(x)? Since it's multiplication
we're dealing with here, let's suppose f(1) = 1 since 1 is the identity for
multiplication. For f(c*x)m we know plugging in 1/c for x would result in...

So, much like addition, we would need to adjust our inputs by multiplicative inverse
(the reciprocal) of c to get the known result of f(1) = 1. Therefore, if |c| = 1,
the magnitude of the input values are unchanged, if |c| > 1, or c is big, the input
value will become smaller (or compressed) to get our known calculations of f, and if
0 < |c| < 1 or c is small, the input value will need to become bigger (or are stretched)
to get our knwon calculations f.

For c*f(x), we know... c*f(1) = c*1 = c

So we would need to adjust our outputs by multiplying by value of c. Therefore
if |c| = 1, the magnitude of the output values are unchanged, if |c| > 1, or c
is big, the output values will become bigger (or are stretched), and if 0 < |c| < 1,
or c is small, the output values will become smaller (or are compressed). We
refer to transformations due to multiplication as scales as they can be thought of
simply stretching / compressing the axes, zooming in / out, or "scaling" the axes
bigger or smaller. Note that if c were negative, this would result in a reflection,
or "flip", as well.

Putting all that together, we have just shown that arithmetically modifying the
input before the calculation of f affects the transformation inversely
(horizontal shifts, scales, and reflections), while arithmetically modifying the
output after calculation of f affects the transformation directly (vertical shifts, scales, and reflections).

Thinking about transformations in the in another direction, if we want to affect
the input or output variables in a certain way, how should we modify the function?
Let's assume we are given the function f(x). If we want to half the input values,
or a horizontal compression of 1/2, we need to multiply by 2 inside the paenthesis
of the function notation, which would give us f(2x). If we want to move horizontally
3 unitz in the positive direction, or move to the right 3 units, we need to add negative 3,
inside the parenthesis of the function notation which would be f(x - 3). Suppose then we want to double
the output values, or get a vertical stretch of 2. To do so, we should multiply by 2 outside the function
notation, or 2f(x). And finally, we want to move vertically in the positive direction
3 units up (up 3), we need to add 3 outside the function notation to get f(x) + 3.
