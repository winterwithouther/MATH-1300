1.4.1 HORIZONTAL LINES (OR CONSTANT FUNCTIONS) AND VERTICAL LINES

Now that we know our common functions and transformations, let's explore
transformations of basic functions. Let's begin with horizontal lines
and vertical lines (though vertical lines admittedly aren't functions of x).
To start, let's be sure we understand how vertical and horizontal lines are defined.

Given a point (a, b), how can we determine the vertical and horizontal lines
through that point? If we want a horizontal line, we know we want to make
sure our y-value is always the same no matter what the x-value is; so the
equation y=b gives us a horizontal line. We can also write this relation as a
function of x, as f(x) = b. Note that x does not show up in the very simple
"calculation" at all, as we want the y-coordinate, or output, to be b no regardless
of x-value. We say that in this case, f(x) is a constant function since it does not change.
Likewise, for the vertical line through the point (a, b), we want our x-coordinate to stay
constant as y varies, so we get the equation x = a. Think about why a vertical line is not a function of x.

Now that we have a better understanding of vertical and horizontal lines, we
can explore how transformations affect them. The most basic vertical line is
the relation x = 0 (or the y-axis), while the most basic horizontal line is the constant
function f(x) = 0 (or the x-axis)
